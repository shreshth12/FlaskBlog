# FlaskBlog
This is my flask blog application being tracked by git. 

Day - 1) Completed my first day of learning flask and created routes and got rid of using envirnment vairables. I instead used __name__ == __main__ to run flask server divectly using python.
 
Day - 2) Completed with template inhertiance and did all the styling required on the webpage. I also learned about url_for function which basically gets the url of a file on your PC and passes it to the html doc using jinja2 

Day - 3) Finally finished the login and registration page with full functionality. Login page is yet to be properly set up using a database engine. Learned how wt-forms in flask work and how we can use it to input data from the user and perform automatic validation checks.

Day - 4) Working on my database. Created the database using sqlalchemy and created its user and posts structure. Will work on integrating it with the application tomorrow.

Day - 5) Finished with Database creation and package management tools. Now it is time to merge the database branch with the main branch. (All errors fixed and web server works good!)

Day - 6) Done with the user authentication page and logic. Used the flask extension of flask_login for the login login and used bcrypt to hash the password and then store it into the sqlite database. 
 
Day - 7) Completed the account update page. Now you can change your username and email, as well as your profile picture after you have created your account. 

Day - 8) Completed the CRUD funtionality of the web application. Now you can update, create or delete the post you made. I learned about bootstrab model and how to update and delete from a sqlite database 

Day - 9) Added pagination to the application. Now every single page on the website shows 5 posts and you can nagivate to the next page by clicking on buttons on the bottom. 

AT THIS POINT THE PROJECT IS ALMOST COMPLETE or Completed and ready to be hosted.

Day - 10) Project is finally completed and is hosted on AWS. You can check it out here : http://myflaskappenv.eba-chvuzsyv.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
