# FlaskBlog
This is my flask blog application being tracked by git. 

Day - 1) Completed my first day of learning flask and created routes and got rid of using envirnment vairables. I instead used __name__ == __main__ to run flask server directly using python.
 
Day - 2) Completed with template inhertiance and did all the styling required on the webpage. I also learned about url_for function which basically gets the url of a file on your PC and passes it to the html doc using jinja2
