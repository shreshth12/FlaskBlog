# FlaskBlog
This is my flask blog application being tracked by git. 

Day - 1) Completed my first day of learning flask and created routes and got rid of using envirnment vairables. I instead used __name__ == __main__ to run flask server divectly using python.
 
Day - 2) Completed with template inhertiance and did all the styling required on the webpage. I also learned about url_for function which basically gets the url of a file on your PC and passes it to the html doc using jinja2 

Day - 3) Finally finished the login and registration page with full functionality. Login page is yet to be properly set up using a database engine. Learned how wt-forms in flask work and how we can use it to input data from the user and perform automatic validation checks.

Day - 4) Working on my database. Created the database using sqlalchemy and created its user and posts structure. Will work on integrating it with the application tomorrow.
